# k3a-lag-exporter

A very simple lag exporter for Kafka topic partitions, where "lag" is
defined as the difference between the last produced index and the last
consumed index.

This implementation is intended to be run in a K8s-like environment,
where pods are restarted on failure. Hence, any exception during
runtime will make the application terminate.

The lag will be exported as a metric for Prometheus, like this:

```text
k3a_consumergroup_group_lag{cluster_name="the-cluster", group="the-group", partition="0", topic="the-topic"} 0
```

There's also a metric reporting the time spent polling the cluster:

```text
k3a_lag_exporter_poll_time_ms{cluster_name="the-cluster"} 8
```

Example configuration:

```text
k3a-lag-exporter {
    poll-interval = 30 seconds
    reporters.prometheus.port = 8000
    reporters.prometheus.metric-namespace = k3a
    clusters = [
    {
        name = "the-kafka-cluster"
        topic-allow-list = [
            "topic1"
            "topic2"
        ]
        topic-deny-list = [
            ".*secret-topic.*"
        ]
        group-allow-list = [
            "public-group.*"
        ]
        group-deny-list = [
            "internal-group.*"
        ]
        bootstrap-servers = "kafka.example.com:9092"
        consumer-properties = {
            security.protocol = "SASL_SSL"
            sasl.mechanism = "PLAIN"
            sasl.jaas.config = "org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username='"${USER}"' password='"${PASSWORD}"';"
        }
        admin-properties = {
            security.protocol = SSL
            ssl.keystore.type = "PKCS12"
            ssl.keystore.location = "./foo.jks"
            ssl.keystore.password = "password"
        }
    }
    ]
}
```

The allow- and deny-lists contain regular expressions that are
implicitly anchored to the beginning and the end of the string.

Filtering happens on the allow-list first, then the deny-list.

* If an allow-list is given, only topics/consumer groups that match an
  entry in the list is passed on.

* Otherwise. of no allow-list is given, every existing topic/consumer
  group is passed on to the deny-list.

* If a deny-list is given, any matching topic/consumer group will be
  removed from the list from the previous steps.

* Otherwise, if no deny-list is given, every topic/consumer group from
  the first to steps will be kept.

The image expects to have a configuration file available as
`/app/k3a-lag-exporter.conf`. You may thus run it like this, giving
the full path to your local configuration file:

```shell
docker run -v $(pwd)/my.conf:/app/k3a-lag-exporter.conf ghcr.io/statnett/k3a-lag-exporter:latest
```
